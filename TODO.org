#+AUTHOR: Pedro Ã‚ngelo

List of tasks to improve hashtable

** TODO Tasks
- global variable to turn on and off messages, such as when the hash table is resized, when a colision occurs, etc
- change hash function to a simpler one
- check c coding conventions and style, and update
- implement different ways to handle colisions:
  - separate chaining
  - open addressing, with either double hashing, linear probing or quadratic probing
- test implementation exaustively, usign valgrind and well as unit tests
- add and enable more types for hash values
