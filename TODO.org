#+TITLE: hashtable TODO
#+AUTHOR: Pedro Ã‚ngelo

List of tasks to improve hashtable

** TODO Tasks
- verify inputs, such as hashtable size, and if min_load_factor is lesser than max_load_factor
- test with valgrind again, some errors remained when downsizing
- change hash function to a simpler one
- check c coding conventions and style, and update
- implement different ways to handle colisions:
  - separate chaining
  - open addressing, with either double hashing, linear probing or quadratic probing
  - the user can choose what of these the hashtable implements by passing a argument
- test implementation exaustively, usign valgrind and well as unit tests
- add and enable more types for hash values
